------------------

* #15: Don't throw an error when resolving a URI which path component is
  empty.
* #16: Correctly parse urls that are only a fragment `#`.


2.1.0 (2016-12-06)
------------------

* Now throwing `InvalidUriException` if a uri passed to the `parse` function
  is invalid or could not be parsed.
* #11: Fix support for URIs that start with a triple slash. PHP's `parse_uri()`
  doesn't support them, so we now have a pure-php fallback in case it fails.
* #9: Fix support for relative URI's that have a non-uri encoded colon `:` in
  them.


2.0.1 (2016-10-27)
------------------

------------------

* Now throwing `InvalidUriException` if a uri passed to the `parse` function

* #11: Fix support for URIs that start with a triple slash. PHP's `parse_uri()`
  doesn't support them, so we now have a pure-php fallback in case it fails.

------------------

* #10: Correctly support file:// URIs in the build() method. (@yuloh)


1.1.0 (2016-03-07)
------------------

* #6: PHP's `parse_url()` corrupts strings if they contain certain
  non ascii-characters such as Chinese or Hebrew. sabre/uri's `parse()`
  function now percent-encodes these characters beforehand.


1.0.1 (2015-04-28)
------------------

* #4: Using php-cs-fixer to automatically enforce coding standards.
